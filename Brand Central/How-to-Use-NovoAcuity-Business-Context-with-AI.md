# How to Use NovoAcuity Business Context with AI Assistants

This guide provides frameworks for effectively communicating NovoAcuity's business context to AI assistants to ensure responses are aligned with your company's mission, frameworks, and objectives.

## Quick Context Options

### Option 1: Snapshot Statement (Recommended for Most Conversations)

Use this concise introduction to quickly establish context:

> "I'm with NovoAcuity, a data consulting firm that uses our proprietary DI-to-PI framework to certify Gold Medal Decision-making. We help executives reduce stress while making better, trustworthy decisions at scale through data ecosystem implementation and AI-enabled decision certification."

### Option 2: Seven Key Points (For More Detailed Context)

When you need slightly more comprehensive context, include these key points:

1. **Core Mission**: NovoAcuity reduces stress in decision-making processes while ensuring decisions are trustworthy and scalable.

2. **Proprietary Framework**: The DI-to-PI (DI2PI) framework enables Gold Medal Decision-making (GMD) certification for critical information.

3. **Three Pillars**: DIOps (Decision Intelligence Operations), EcoOps (Data Ecosystem Operations), and PIOps (Presentation Intelligence) form an integrated approach.

4. **Target Audience**: Senior executives (CEOs, CIOs, CDOs, CADIOs) and their teams across all industries.

5. **Service Categories**: Foundational Data Ecosystem Implementations and AI-Enabled Certification of Decisions.

6. **Key Differentiator**: A unified, platform-agnostic approach that addresses the entire decision-making process, unlike competitors who focus on isolated aspects.

7. **Value Proposition**: Enables organizations to visually identify certified trustworthy information, allowing executives to focus on applying their expertise rather than questioning the reliability of their data.

## Effective Conversation Techniques

### Within Ongoing Conversations

1. **Reference the synthesis in your questions**: Begin with "In the context of NovoAcuity's business..." or "Considering the DI-to-PI framework I've shared with you..."

2. **Use specific terminology**: Mention key concepts like "Gold Medal Decision-making," "DIOps," "EcoOps," or "PIOps" when relevant to trigger recall of your unique business approach.

3. **Relate questions to your core mission**: Frame questions in terms of how they help reduce stress in decision-making or improve trustworthiness of decisions at scale.

4. **Specify target audience considerations**: When seeking analysis, mention which stakeholders you're addressing (executives, data teams, etc.) to ensure the response is properly tailored.

5. **For comparative analysis**: Ask the AI to compare new ideas against your established frameworks and methodologies to evaluate fit and potential.

6. **Use the document as a reference point**: Simply state "Using the NovoAcuity synthesis as context, analyze..." to ensure the AI incorporates your business perspective.

7. **For innovation exploration**: Ask "How might this concept enhance or integrate with the DI-to-PI framework?" when exploring new ideas.

### For New Conversations

1. **Create a project/workspace**: When starting a new conversation, create a named project (if the platform allows it) that includes your business context. This way, the context is associated with that specific project.

2. **Use a brief context reminder**: Begin new conversations with a condensed reminder using either the snapshot statement or the seven key points above.

3. **Provide a shortened reference**: Use the seven key points format when you need more detail than the snapshot but less than the full synthesis.

4. **Link to previous conversations**: If the platform allows, reference or link to previous conversations where you established the context.

5. **Use a profile/settings approach**: Check if the platform allows you to save context information in your user profile or conversation settings that would automatically be applied to new conversations.

6. **Snapshot approach**: Use the snapshot statement for quick context establishment that gives the AI enough information to recall key aspects of your business while keeping your initial message concise.

## Best Practices

- **Start with context**: Always establish NovoAcuity context at the beginning of new conversations or when switching topics significantly.

- **Be specific with terminology**: Use NovoAcuity-specific terms like DI-to-PI, GMD, DIOps, EcoOps, and PIOps to help the AI understand your unique approach.

- **Reference your mission**: Frame requests in terms of reducing decision-making stress and improving trustworthiness.

- **Specify stakeholders**: Clearly identify whether you're focusing on executives, technical teams, or other stakeholders.

- **Leverage your differentiators**: Emphasize your unified, end-to-end approach when comparing against alternatives or competitors.

## Template Examples

**For analysis requests:**
"Using NovoAcuity's DI-to-PI framework as context, analyze how [topic/concept] could enhance our Gold Medal Decision-making approach for senior executives."

**For innovation exploration:**
"Considering NovoAcuity's mission to reduce decision-making stress, how might [new concept/technology] integrate with our three pillars of DIOps, EcoOps, and PIOps?"

**For competitive analysis:**
"Given NovoAcuity's unified approach to decision-making certification, how does [competitor/alternative] compare to our DI-to-PI framework?"
