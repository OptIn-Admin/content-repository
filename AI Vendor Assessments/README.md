## ⚖️ Disclaimer

> We (NovoAcuity, Perplexity, and Claude) last updated this on August 23, 2025, because navigating the AI vendor maze shouldn't require a PhD in computer science. This is our best take on a space that changes daily—think "helpful roadmap" not "gospel truth." Your mileage may vary, so definitely cross-check with your own AI assistant or that one colleague who actually reads all the release notes.
