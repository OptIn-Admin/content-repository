#### The Fine Print

We (NovoAcuity, Perplexity, and Claude) last updated this on August 23, 2025, because navigating the AI vendor maze shouldn't require a PhD in computer science. This is our best take on a space that changes daily—think "helpful roadmap" not "gospel truth." Your mileage may vary, so definitely cross-check with your own AI assistant or that one colleague who actually reads all the release notes. Found something that makes you go "wait, that's not right"? Please share your wisdom in the comments—the AI world gets better when we all contribute our perspectives.
